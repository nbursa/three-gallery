    <p>
      Three.js makes it easier to implement 3D objects and animations on the
      web, providing a powerful framework for 3D graphics programming that is
      accessible and versatile. One of the simplest yet fundamental 3D shapes is
      the box, which serves as an excellent starting point for understanding how
      to manipulate objects in a 3D space using Three.js. This article delves
      into creating a spinning box component, showcasing the process of
      integrating Three.js into a typical web application.
    </p>

    <h4>Getting Started with Three.js</h4>

    <p>
      Before diving into the specifics of the box component, it is important to
      understand the basic setup required for any Three.js scene. This setup
      includes creating a scene, a camera, and a renderer:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scene</strong>: The container for all your 3D objects.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera</strong>: Defines the point of view from which you’ll see
        the scene.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Renderer</strong>: Renders the graphics as defined by the
        camera’s view onto an HTML canvas.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For our box component, these essentials are instantiated in a class that
      extends a <code>ThreejsElement</code>, ensuring that all 3D elements have
      a standard implementation framework.
    </p>

    <h4>Building the Box Component</h4>

    <p>
      The <code>SpinningBox</code> class illustrates how to create a basic 3D
      box and add dynamic behavior such as spinning. The key elements in this
      process include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Geometry</strong>: The shape and size of the 3D object. In this
        case, a simple box geometry is used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Material</strong>: Defines the appearance of the surface of the
        geometry. Our box uses a textured material loaded from an image file,
        enhancing the visual appeal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mesh</strong>: Combines the geometry with the material, which
        can then be added to the scene.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a brief look at how the <code>SpinningBox</code> is set up:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(2, 2, 2);
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = textureLoader.load("/images/steam.webp");
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture, roughness: 0, metalness: 0 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);</code></pre>

    <h4>Animation and Lighting</h4>

    <p>
      To bring the box to life, animation and lighting are critical. The box
      rotates continuously around its axes using the following lines of code
      inside the <code>render</code> method, which updates on each frame
      rendered by the browser:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">this.cube.rotation.x += 0.001;
this.cube.rotation.y += 0.001;</code></pre>

    <p>
      Lighting is equally important to ensure the box is visible and has a sense
      of depth:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Ambient Light</strong>: Illuminates all parts of the scene
        equally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Point Light</strong>: Emits light from a specific position in
        the scene, like a light bulb.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Handling Browser Events</h4>

    <p>
      To ensure the 3D scene responds to user interaction and browser events,
      such as resizing the window, event listeners are added:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">window.addEventListener("resize", this.onWindowResize, false);</code></pre>

    <p>
      The resize handler adjusts the camera’s aspect ratio and the renderer’s
      size, ensuring that the 3D scene dynamically fits the display window
      without distortion.
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

    <p>
      The <code>SpinningBox</code> component in Three.js is a simple yet
      powerful demonstration of using 3D graphics on the web. By understanding
      how to manipulate basic shapes like a box, developers can build more
      complex and interactive 3D applications. This example serves as a
      foundational block for aspiring graphics programmers and web developers
      interested in bringing 3D interactivity to their applications.
